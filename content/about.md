Hi there! I'm alienchow@, and I am currently working as a Site Reliability
Engineer for the Government Technology Agency of Singapore. My work involves
building SRE capability and defining the SRE organisational function for
several of our critical services.

Prior to this, I worked for 7 years as an SRE in Google, 2 years in
[Grab](https://engineering.grab.com/authors#lian-yuanlin), and 2 years in
[Koei Tecmo](https://www.koeitecmo.com.sg/) making cat games.

My passion now lies in debugging team operations and fixing the capability
gaps within the entire Singapore government in a scalable manner.
