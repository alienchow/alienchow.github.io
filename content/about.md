Hi there! I'm alienchow@, and I am currently working as a Site Reliability
Engineer for the Government Technology Agency of Singapore. My work involves
building SRE capability and defining the SRE organisational functions for
several of our critical services.

My prior work is as follows:

* Site Reliability Engineer in Google on
[Spanner](https://research.google/pubs/spanner-googles-globally-distributed-database-2/),
[Voice](https://voice.google.com/),
[Meet](https://meet.google.com/),
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) Video Processing.
* Backend Engineer in [Grab](https://engineering.grab.com/authors#lian-yuanlin).
* Game Programmer in [Koei Tecmo](https://www.koeitecmo.com.sg/) making cat
games.
* My own game studio.

My passion now lies in debugging team operations and fixing the capability
gaps within the entire Singapore government in a scalable manner.
